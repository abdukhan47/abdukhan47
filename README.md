  <strong>👋🏼 Hello World! I'm Abdulah Khan!</strong><br>
  😄 Pronouns: he/him/his.<br><br>
  
  🎓 I am a senior pursuing my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at the University of Southern California. I have gained a strong academic foundation in various aspects of Computer Science such as: app development, software engineering, and video game development.<br><br>
  
  💻 My journey in tech has ranged from academia to industry. I've spent a year at USC's Space Engineering Research Center where I worked in satellite technology. I have also interned at Amazon Web Services and J.P Morgan & Chase. In addition, I've competed and earned awards in several hackathons.<br><br>
  
  🌍 Driven by a passion for technology and its transformative power, I am especially interested in the power of tech for social good. I've worked with several non-profits and helped them in developing web-applications and other platforms.<br><br>
